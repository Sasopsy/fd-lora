# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The fd-lora (fast dynamic LoRA) library is an inference-only library designed to accelerate LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) computations through optimized CUDA kernels. The library focuses on dynamic LoRA application without weight fusion, providing significant performance improvements for machine learning inference workloads. The initial implementation will support Triton and CUDA backends with seamless integration into the Hugging Face ecosystem through PEFT compatibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to use dynamic LoRA adapters during inference without fusing them with base model weights, so that I can maintain flexibility while achieving optimal performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user applies a LoRA adapter to a model THEN the system SHALL compute the output using dynamic application without modifying the base model weights
2. WHEN multiple LoRA adapters are available THEN the system SHALL support switching between adapters at runtime without model reloading
3. WHEN computing LoRA outputs THEN the system SHALL use fused CUDA kernels to minimize memory transfers and maximize throughput

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with Hugging Face libraries, I want seamless compatibility with PEFT, so that I can use fd-lora as a drop-in replacement for existing LoRA implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with PEFT THEN the system SHALL provide compatible interfaces that work with existing PEFT LoRA configurations
2. WHEN used with Transformers library THEN the system SHALL support all standard model architectures that PEFT supports
3. WHEN used with Diffusers library THEN the system SHALL integrate with diffusion model pipelines without code changes
4. WHEN loading PEFT-compatible LoRA weights THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and load the appropriate adapter configurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious developer, I want optimized CUDA kernel implementations, so that I can achieve maximum inference speed for LoRA-enabled models.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing LoRA computations THEN the system SHALL use Triton-based fused kernels as the primary backend
2. WHEN Triton is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to optimized CUDA kernels
3. WHEN performing matrix operations THEN the system SHALL minimize memory allocations and data transfers between GPU memory regions
4. WHEN processing batched inputs THEN the system SHALL optimize kernel launches for batch processing efficiency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a library user, I want a simple and intuitive API, so that I can easily integrate fd-lora into my existing inference pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing the library THEN the system SHALL provide a simple configuration interface for backend selection
2. WHEN loading models THEN the system SHALL support standard model loading patterns similar to Hugging Face libraries
3. WHEN applying LoRA adapters THEN the system SHALL provide clear methods for adapter management and switching
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide informative error messages with suggested solutions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer planning for future extensibility, I want a modular backend architecture, so that I can add support for additional compute backends like Cutlass later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the backend interface THEN the system SHALL use an abstract backend pattern that supports multiple implementations
2. WHEN adding new backends THEN the system SHALL require minimal changes to the core library interface
3. WHEN selecting backends THEN the system SHALL provide runtime backend detection and selection capabilities
4. WHEN backends are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to available alternatives

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality-conscious developer, I want comprehensive testing and validation, so that I can trust the library's correctness and performance claims.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing kernel operations THEN the system SHALL include numerical accuracy tests comparing outputs to reference implementations
2. WHEN measuring performance THEN the system SHALL include benchmarking utilities that compare against standard PEFT implementations
3. WHEN testing compatibility THEN the system SHALL validate integration with major Hugging Face model architectures
4. WHEN releasing versions THEN the system SHALL include automated testing for different CUDA versions and GPU architectures
